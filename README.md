While We Wait

A mod to make loading times more bearable

If you want to use this in your dev workspace add this to your build.gradle

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://minecraft.curseforge.com/api/maven"}
}

dependencies {
    modCompile "whilewewait:whilewewait:1.2.1"
}
```
If there is a newer verison out and I havent updated it check the tags and use the latest number instead of 1.2.1
